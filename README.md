# odin-etch
Web application that offers an interface for users to draw images within their browser. (The Odin Project)

In this project, I will use my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a simple application that emulates the an etch-a-sketch toy. 

This project should demonstrate my understanding of DOM manipulation and site design.
